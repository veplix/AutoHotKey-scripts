  # AutoHotKey scripts that emulates hyprland binds for windows

</div>

`Binds` for standard - non-admin scripts (like opening some programs Firefox, Telegram etc.)

`Radycal_binds` for starting programs with admin privileges (emulating alt+f4 throught win+w, because some programs which are started with admin rights are not closing without that)

> [!NOTE]
> Put the `AutoHotKey` folder in `Documents` folder

> [!TIP]
> I suggest to put those scripts in windows `Task scheduler` on startup. Creating custom task

### Task scheduer
  A little guide for creating new task for immediate scripts startup
    
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you using this method, create two separate tasks (one for non-admin (Binds), and second for admin (Radycal_binds)
